To preserve predictability while permitting linguistic extension, Racket comes equipped with a module system carefully designed to accommodate <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/macromod.pdf">composable and compilable macros</a>. One of the module system’s foundational properties is its <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/eval-model.html#%28part._separate-compilation%29"><em>separate compilation guarantee</em></a>, which imposes strong, unbreakable limits on the extent of compile-time side-effects. It is <em>essential</em> for preserving static guarantees in a world where compiling a module can execute arbitrary code, and despite numerous unsafe trapdoors that have crept into Racket since its birth as PLT Scheme, none have ever given the programmer the ability to cheat it.</p><p>Yet today, in this blog post, we’re going to do exactly that.</p><p><a href="/blog/2019/04/21/defeating-racket-s-separate-compilation-guarantee/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2018/10/06/macroexpand-anywhere-with-local-apply-transformer/">Macroexpand anywhere with <code>local-apply-transformer</code>!</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2018-10-06">2018-10-06</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/macros.html">macros</a></div></header><p>Racket programmers are accustomed to the language’s incredible capacity for extension and customization. Writing useful macros that do complicated things is easy, and it’s simple to add new syntactic forms to meet domain-specific needs. However, it doesn’t take long before many budding macrologists bump into the realization that only <em>certain positions</em> in Racket code are subject to macroexpansion.</p><p>To illustrate, consider a macro that provides a Clojure-style <code>let</code> form:</p><pre><code class="pygments"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">require</span> <span class="n">syntax/parse/define</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">define-simple-macro</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">clj-let</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="n">~seq</span> <span class="n">x:id</span> <span class="n">e:expr</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">...</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">body:expr</span> <span class="n">...+</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span> <span class="p">([</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">...</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">body</span> <span class="k">...</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre><p>This can be used anywhere an expression is expected, and it does as one would expect:</p><pre><code class="pygments"><span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">clj-let</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
            <span class="n">y</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="mi">3</span></code></pre><p>However, a novice macro programmer might realize that <code>clj-let</code> really only modifies the syntax of <em>binding pairs</em> for a <code>let</code> form. Therefore, could one define a macro that only adjusts the binding pairs of some existing <code>let</code> form instead of expanding to an entire <code>let</code>? That is, could one write the above example like this:</p><pre><code class="pygments"><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">define-simple-macro</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">clj-binding-pairs</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="n">~seq</span> <span class="n">x:id</span> <span class="n">e:expr</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">...</span><span class="p">])</span>
  <span class="p">([</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">...</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">clj-binding-pairs</span>
        <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
         <span class="n">y</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="mi">3</span></code></pre><p>The answer is <em>no</em>: the binding pairs of a <code>let</code> form are not subject to macroexpansion, so the above attempt fails with a syntax error. In this blog post, we will examine the reasons behind this limitation, then explain how to overcome it using a solution that allows macroexpansion <em>anywhere</em> in a Racket program.</p><p><a href="/blog/2018/10/06/macroexpand-anywhere-with-local-apply-transformer/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2018/09/13/custom-core-forms-in-racket-part-ii-generalizing-to-arbitrary-expressions-and-internal-definitions/">Custom core forms in Racket, part II: generalizing to arbitrary expressions and internal definitions</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2018-09-13">2018-09-13</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/macros.html">macros</a></div></header><p>In my <a href="/blog/2018/04/15/reimplementing-hackett-s-type-language-expanding-to-custom-core-forms-in-racket/">previous blog post</a>, I covered the process involved in creating a small language with a custom set of core forms. Specifically, it discussed what was necessary to create Hackett’s type language, which involved expanding to custom expressions. While somewhat involved, Hackett’s type language was actually a relatively simple example to use, since it only made use of a subset of the linguistic features Racket supports. In this blog post, I’ll demonstrate how that same technique can be generalized to support runtime bindings and internal definitions, two key concepts useful if intending to develop a more featureful language than Hackett’s intentionally-restrictive type system.</p><p><a href="/blog/2018/09/13/custom-core-forms-in-racket-part-ii-generalizing-to-arbitrary-expressions-and-internal-definitions/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2018/04/15/reimplementing-hackett-s-type-language-expanding-to-custom-core-forms-in-racket/">Reimplementing Hackett’s type language: expanding to custom core forms in Racket</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2018-04-15">2018-04-15</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/hackett.html">hackett</a>, <a href="/tags/macros.html">macros</a></div></header><p>In the past couple of weeks, I <a href="https://github.com/lexi-lambda/hackett/commit/ba64193da38f63dab2523f42c1b7614cdfa8c935">completely rewrote the implementation of Hackett’s type language</a> to improve the integration between the type representation and Racket’s macro system. The new type language effectively implements a way to reuse as much of the Racket macroexpanding infrastructure as possible while expanding a completely custom language, which uses a custom set of core forms. The fundamental technique used to do so is not novel, and it seems to be periodically rediscovered every so often, but it has never been published or documented anywhere, and getting it right involves understanding a great number of subtleties about the Racket macro system. While I cannot entirely eliminate the need to understand those subtleties, in this blog post, I hope to make the secret sauce considerably less secret.</p><p>This blog post is both a case study on how I implemented the expander for Hackett’s new type language and a discussion of how such a technique can apply more generally. Like <a href="/blog/2017/10/27/a-space-of-their-own-adding-a-type-namespace-to-hackett/">my previous blog post on Hackett</a>, which covered the implementation of its namespace system, the implementation section of this blog post is highly technical and probably requires significant experience with Racket’s macro system to completely comprehend. However, the surrounding material is written to be more accessible, so even if you are not a Racket programmer, you should hopefully be able to understand the big ideas behind this change.</p><p><a href="/blog/2018/04/15/reimplementing-hackett-s-type-language-expanding-to-custom-core-forms-in-racket/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2017/10/27/a-space-of-their-own-adding-a-type-namespace-to-hackett/">A space of their own: adding a type namespace to Hackett</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2017-10-27">2017-10-27</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/hackett.html">hackett</a>, <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/programming-languages.html">programming languages</a></div></header><p>As previously discussed on this blog, <a href="https://github.com/lexi-lambda/hackett">my programming language, Hackett</a>, is a fusion of two languages, Haskell and Racket. What happens when two distinctly different programming languages collide? Hackett recently faced that very problem when it came to the question of namespacing: Haskell has two namespaces, one for values and another for types, but Racket is a staunch Lisp-1 with a single namespace for all bindings. Which convention should Hackett adopt?</p><p>For now, at least, the answer is that Hackett will emulate Haskell: <strong>Hackett now has two namespaces</strong>. Of course, Hackett is embedded in Racket, so what did it take to add an entirely new namespace to a language that possesses only one? The answer was a little more than I had hoped, but it was still remarkably simple given the problem: after two weeks of hacking, I’ve managed to get something working.</p><p><a href="/blog/2017/10/27/a-space-of-their-own-adding-a-type-namespace-to-hackett/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2017/08/28/hackett-progress-report-documentation-quality-of-life-and-snake/">Hackett progress report: documentation, quality of life, and snake</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2017-08-28">2017-08-28</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/hackett.html">hackett</a>, <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/haskell.html">haskell</a></div></header><p>Three months ago, <a href="/blog/2017/05/27/realizing-hackett-a-metaprogrammable-haskell/">I wrote a blog post describing my new, prototype implementation of my programming language, Hackett</a>. At the time, some things looked promising—the language already included algebraic datatypes, typeclasses, laziness, and even a mini, proof of concept web server. It was, however, clearly still rather rough around the edges—error messages were poor, features were sometimes brittle, the REPL experience was less than ideal, and there was no documentation to speak of. In the time since, while the language is still experimental, I have tackled a handful of those issues, and I am excited to announce <a href="https://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/doc/hackett@hackett-doc/"><strong>the first (albeit quite incomplete) approach to Hackett’s documentation</strong></a>.</p><p>I’d recommend clicking that link above and at least skimming around before reading the rest of this blog post, as its remainder will describe some of the pieces that didn’t end up in the documentation: the development process, the project’s status, a small demo, and some other details from behind the scenes.</p><p><a href="/blog/2017/08/28/hackett-progress-report-documentation-quality-of-life-and-snake/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2017/08/12/user-programmable-infix-operators-in-racket/">User-programmable infix operators in Racket</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2017-08-12">2017-08-12</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/hackett.html">hackett</a>, <a href="/tags/macros.html">macros</a></div></header><p>Lisps are not known for infix operators, quite the opposite; infix operators generally involve more syntax and parsing than Lispers are keen to support. However, in <a href="https://github.com/lexi-lambda/hackett">Hackett</a>, all functions are curried, and variable-arity functions do not exist. Infix operators are almost necessary for that to be palatable, and though there are other reasons to want them, it may not be obvious how to support them without making the reader considerably more complex.</p><p>Fortunately, if we require users to syntactically specify where they wish to use infix expressions, support for infix operators is not only possible, but can support be done <em>without</em> modifying the stock <code>#lang racket</code> reader. Futhermore, the resulting technique makes it possible for fixity information to be specified locally in a way that cooperates nicely with the Racket macro system, allowing the parsing of infix expressions to be manipulated at compile-time by users’ macros.</p><p><a href="/blog/2017/08/12/user-programmable-infix-operators-in-racket/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2017/05/27/realizing-hackett-a-metaprogrammable-haskell/">Realizing Hackett, a metaprogrammable Haskell</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2017-05-27">2017-05-27</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/hackett.html">hackett</a>, <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/haskell.html">haskell</a>, <a href="/tags/programming-languages.html">programming languages</a></div></header><p><a href="/blog/2017/01/02/rascal-a-haskell-with-more-parentheses/">Almost five months ago, I wrote a blog post about my new programming language, Hackett</a>, a fanciful sketch of a programming language from a far-off land with Haskell’s type system and Racket’s macros.
