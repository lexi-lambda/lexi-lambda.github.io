I loathed doing the same repetitive task over and over again, and I always yearned for a way to <a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">solve the general problem</a>. When I learned about programming, I was immediately hooked: it was <em>so easy</em> to turn repetitive tasks into automated pipelines that would free me from ever having to do the same dull, frustrating exercise ever again.</p><p>Of course, one of the first things I found out once I’d started was that nothing is ever quite so simple. Before long, my solutions to eliminate repetition grew repetitive, and it became clear I spent a lot of time typing out the same things, over and over again, creating the very problem I had initially set out to destroy. It was through this that I grew interested in functions, classes, and other repetition-reducing aids, and soon enough, I discovered the wonderful world of <strong>abstraction</strong>.</p><p><a href="/blog/2016/08/11/climbing-the-infinite-ladder-of-abstraction/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2016/02/18/simple-safe-multimethods-in-racket/">Simple, safe multimethods in Racket</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2016-02-18">2016-02-18</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/macros.html">macros</a></div></header><p>Racket ships with <code>racket/generic</code>, a system for defining <em>generic methods</em>, functions that work differently depending on what sort of value they are supplied. I have made heavy use of this feature in my collections library, and it has worked well for my needs, but that system does have a bit of a limitation: it only supports <em>single dispatch</em>. Method implementations may only be chosen based on a single argument, so multiple dispatch is impossible.</p><p><a href="/blog/2016/02/18/simple-safe-multimethods-in-racket/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2015/12/21/adts-in-typed-racket-with-macros/">ADTs in Typed Racket with macros</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2015-12-21">2015-12-21</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/typed-racket.html">typed racket</a>, <a href="/tags/macros.html">macros</a></div></header><p>Macros are one of Racket's flagship features, and its macro system really is state of the art. Of course, it can sometimes be difficult to demonstrate <em>why</em> macros are so highly esteemed, in part because it can be hard to find self-contained examples of using macros in practice. Of course, one thing that macros are perfect for is filling a "hole" in the language by introducing a feature a language lacks, and one of those features in Typed Racket is <strong>ADTs</strong>.</p><p><a href="/blog/2015/12/21/adts-in-typed-racket-with-macros/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2015/08/30/managing-application-configuration-with-envy/">Managing application configuration with Envy</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2015-08-30">2015-08-30</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/envy.html">envy</a>, <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/12factor.html">12factor</a></div></header><p>Application configuration can be a pain.

It has support for a variety of languages built-in, but Racket is not currently among them. Fortunately, Heroku provides an interface for adding custom build processes for arbitrary types of applications, called “buildpacks”. I've built one for Racket apps, and with just a little bit of configuration, it’s possible to get a Racket webserver running on Heroku.</p><p><a href="/blog/2015/08/22/deploying-racket-applications-on-heroku/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2015/07/18/automatically-deploying-a-frog-powered-blog-to-github-pages/">Automatically deploying a Frog-powered blog to GitHub pages</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2015-07-18">2015-07-18</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/frog.html">frog</a>, <a href="/tags/meta.html">meta</a></div></header><p>So, I have a blog now.
