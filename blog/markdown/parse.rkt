#| This module implements a simple markdown parser based very loosely on the
algorithm given in the CommonMark specification:

    https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#appendix-a-parsing-strategy

This implementation is very much /not/ CommonMark-compliant. For the most part,
it is stricter than CommonMark---not all inputs are accepted as valid markdown.
The accepted subset is chosen to be both simple to parse and relatively portable
with other markdown implementations.

Although the parser is implemented using megaparsack, it is unusual in that it
is really a one-line-at-a-time parser that switches between various states. This
makes it easier to parse Markdown’s indentation-sensitive block structure.

Note [Open blocks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Philosophically, the parser is a context-sensitive state machine. Some example
states are “start of line”, “scanning block prefixes”, and “scanning content”.
Each state is implemented as a parser-returning function that accepts its
context as arguments. Different states accept the context in slightly different
ways, but in all cases, the parsing context is a stack of /open blocks/, as
described in the CommonMark appendix linked above.

Internally, the parser represents most open blocks using the same structures it
uses to represent closed blocks (the latter of which are recognized by the
public `block?` predicate), but there are two differences:

  * Open lists are represented by the `open-list` and `list-element` structures,
    which record additional indentation information.

  * Open footnote declarations are represented by the `footnote` structure.
    These never appear in closed blocks, since they are collected into a field
    of the top-level `document` structure, but they can appear nested in other
    blocks, so parsing them must still be indentation-aware.

Note [In-blocks and out-blocks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The naming conventions in this module distinguish two forms of block context:

  * When a function accepts a list of open blocks /shallowest-first/, the
    argument is named `out-blocks`. This is because it’s useful to access
    shallower blocks before deeper blocks when the parser is “outside” the blocks.

  * Dually, when a function accepts a list of open blocks /deepest-first/, the
    argument is named `in-blocks`.

As an example, the `scan-line-start` function accepts an `out-blocks` argument
because it must traverse the open blocks from the outside in to parse the
indentation at the start of the line. In contrast, the `scan-block-content`
function accepts an `in-blocks` argument, since the indentation has been parsed
for all open blocks, and the content should be added to the innermost block.

The `scan-block-prefixes` function bridges the gap between `scan-line-start` and
`scan-block-content`, so it accepts both `in-blocks` and `out-blocks` arguments.
As it parses the indentation for each block, it transfers it from the
`out-blocks` stack to the `in-blocks` stack, morally “entering” the block. |#

#| Note [Unconditionally parse list elements]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a markdown document that looks like this:

  1 |* foo
  2 |
  3 |bar

The correct parse here is clearly an unordered list with a single element,
followed by a paragraph. However, because the list is unindented, we will end up
in a parsing context that looks like this at the beginning of line 3:

  location: 3 |bar
              ^
  state: scan-block-content
  in blocks: document
  inner block: open-list['unordered 0]
               └ paragraph{foo}

At first blush, this is a problem, because in `scan-block-content`, we
/unconditionally/ parse a list element if the innermost block is an `open-list`.
Since line 3 does not start with a `*` or `-`, the parser fails.

However, note that the parser fails /without consuming input/. It is not
immediately obvious that this helps---calls to `scan-block-content` are usually
placed as the /last/ alternative of an `or/p` sequence---but in fact this
failure allows backtracking to an even earlier choice point. Specifically, it
can backtrack all the way to this state:

  location: 3 |bar
              ^
  state: scan-block-prefixes
  in blocks: document
  out blocks: open-list['unordered 0]
              list-element[2]
              └ paragraph{foo}

Note, crucially, that we’ve backtracked far enough that the `open-list` is still
in `out-blocks`, not `in-blocks`. This is somewhat surprising, because
`scan-block-prefix` will always succeed on an unindented `open-list`,
immediately moving it into `in-blocks`. However, since `scan-block-prefix` does
not consume any input in that case, the parser has not yet committed to entering
that block.

This subtlety means we do not need to treat this case specially in
`scan-block-content`: we can just unconditionally parse a list element when
inside an `open-list`. And intuitively, this makes some sense given
megaparsack’s backtracking behavior: the parser only commits when consuming
input, and at the start of the line, no input has been consumed. |#
