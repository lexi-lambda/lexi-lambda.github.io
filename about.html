Unlike most markup languages, every Scribble document is a <em>program</em> that evaluates to a document, which can then be rendered using one of a number of different backends. Scribble provides a TeX-like notation for writing such programs, but unlike TeX—which is essentially an overgrown macro preprocessor—Scribble is a full-fledged functional programming language. In fact, the Scribble syntax is really just an alternate notation for Racket itself, so all the libraries and abstractions available in Racket can be used more or less directly in a Scribble document.</p><p>This makes Scribble a remarkably powerful tool for writing prose documents, and indeed, it serves as the foundation for Racket’s <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/">best-in-class documentation system</a>, among other things. Using it to power a blog is perhaps a bit overkill, but it gives me the wonderful ability to define whatever abstractions I desire to make blogging as effortless as possible. For example, after finding myself linking to Hackage packages quite frequently, I decided to define a one-line function:</p><pre><code class="pygments"><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hackage-package</span> <span class="n">package-name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hyperlink</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">string-append</span> <span class="s2">"https://hackage.haskell.org/package/"</span> <span class="n">package-name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">package-name</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre><p>Now all I have to do is write <code>@hackage-package{lens}</code> and I get <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens">lens</a>. Sure, it’s not exactly mind-blowing, but it’s certainly convenient… and of course, the most significant advantages involve abstractions too elaborate to describe here.</p><p>This site is, naturally, open source, so if you’d like to see how all the pieces fit together for yourself, feel free to clone <a href="https://github.com/lexi-lambda/lexi-lambda.github.io">the GitHub repository</a>.
