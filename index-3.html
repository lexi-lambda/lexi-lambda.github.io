These boundaries make it easy to stub out parts of a system to test functionality in isolation, which makes it possible to write fast, deterministic test suites that are robust in the face of change. When writing Haskell, it can be unclear how to accomplish the same goals: even inside pure code, it can become difficult to test a particular code path without also testing all its collaborators.</p><p>Fortunately, by taking advantage of Haskell’s expressive type system, it’s possible to not only achieve parity with object-oriented testing techniques, but also to provide stronger static guarantees as well. Furthermore, it’s all possible without resorting to extra-linguistic hacks that static object-oriented languages sometimes use for mocking, such as dynamic bytecode generation.</p><p><a href="/blog/2016/10/03/using-types-to-unit-test-in-haskell/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2016/08/24/understanding-the-npm-dependency-model/">Understanding the npm dependency model</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2016-08-24">2016-08-24</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/javascript.html">javascript</a></div></header><p>Currently, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</a> is <em>the</em> package manager for the frontend world.

I loathed doing the same repetitive task over and over again, and I always yearned for a way to <a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">solve the general problem</a>. When I learned about programming, I was immediately hooked: it was <em>so easy</em> to turn repetitive tasks into automated pipelines that would free me from ever having to do the same dull, frustrating exercise ever again.</p><p>Of course, one of the first things I found out once I’d started was that nothing is ever quite so simple. Before long, my solutions to eliminate repetition grew repetitive, and it became clear I spent a lot of time typing out the same things, over and over again, creating the very problem I had initially set out to destroy. It was through this that I grew interested in functions, classes, and other repetition-reducing aids, and soon enough, I discovered the wonderful world of <strong>abstraction</strong>.</p><p><a href="/blog/2016/08/11/climbing-the-infinite-ladder-of-abstraction/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2016/06/12/four-months-with-haskell/">Four months with Haskell</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2016-06-12">2016-06-12</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/haskell.html">haskell</a>, <a href="/tags/functional-programming.html">functional programming</a></div></header><p>At the end of January of this year, I switched to a new job, almost exclusively because I was enticed by the idea of being able to write Haskell. The concept of using such an interesting programming language every day instead of what I’d been doing before (mostly Rails and JavaScript) was very exciting, and I’m pleased to say that the switch seems to have been well worth it.</p><p>Haskell was a language I had played with in the past but never really used for anything terribly practical, but lately I think I can confidently say that it really is an <em>incredible</em> programming language. At the same time, it has some significant drawbacks, too, though probably not the ones people expect. I certainly wasn’t prepared for some of the areas where Haskell would blow me away, nor was I capable of realizing which parts would leave me hopelessly frustrated until I actually sat down and started writing lots and lots of code.</p><p><a href="/blog/2016/06/12/four-months-with-haskell/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2016/02/18/simple-safe-multimethods-in-racket/">Simple, safe multimethods in Racket</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2016-02-18">2016-02-18</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/racket.html">racket</a>, <a href="/tags/macros.html">macros</a></div></header><p>Racket ships with <code>racket/generic</code>, a system for defining <em>generic methods</em>, functions that work differently depending on what sort of value they are supplied.

Of course, it can sometimes be difficult to demonstrate <em>why</em> macros are so highly esteemed, in part because it can be hard to find self-contained examples of using macros in practice. Of course, one thing that macros are perfect for is filling a "hole" in the language by introducing a feature a language lacks, and one of those features in Typed Racket is <strong>ADTs</strong>.</p><p><a href="/blog/2015/12/21/adts-in-typed-racket-with-macros/"><span class="read-more-text">Read more</span> →</a></p></article><article class="inline"><header><h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2015/11/06/functionally-updating-record-types-in-elm/">Functionally updating record types in Elm</a></h1><div class="date-and-tags"><time datetime="2015-11-06">2015-11-06</time> <span style="margin: 0 5px">⦿</span> <a href="/tags/elm.html">elm</a></div></header><p><a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a> is a wonderful language for building web apps, and I love so much of its approach to language design. Elm does so many things <em>right</em> straight out of the box, and that's a real breath of fresh air in the intersection of functional programming and web development. Still, it gets one thing wrong, and unfortunately, that one thing is incredibly important. Elm took the "functions" out of "functional record types".</p><p>Almost any software program, at its core, is all about data. Maybe it's about computing data, maybe it's about manipulating data, or maybe it's about displaying data, but at the end of the day, some sort of data model is going to be needed. The functional model is a breathtakingly elegant system for handling data and shuttling it around throughout a program, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">functional reactive programming</a>, which Elm uses to model event-like interactions, makes this model work even better.
